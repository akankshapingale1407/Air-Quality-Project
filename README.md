# Air-Quality-Project
<h3><b><u>Title: IoT-Based Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring and Alarm System</u></b></h3>
<br>
<h5><b>Overview:</b></h5>
This project presents a smart Internet of Things (IoT) solution for real-time monitoring of air quality, temperature, and humidity using low-cost sensors and cloud connectivity. The system is designed using a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller, MQ135 gas sensor, and DHT11 temperature & humidity sensor. The core objective is to measure pollution levels and trigger a local alert (buzzer and LED) when air quality exceeds a dangerous threshold.<br>
Sensor readings are transmitted to the ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform via Wi-Fi, enabling live data visualization, remote monitoring, and potential integration with mobile apps or dashboards. The system is compact, scalable, and ideal for smart city and health-focused applications.
